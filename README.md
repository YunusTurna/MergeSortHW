# Merge Sort Homework

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm using the example input list.

## Input
The initial list to be sorted:
[16, 21, 11, 8, 12, 22]

## Merge Sort Process

1. **Divide the list into two halves:**
   [16, 21, 11]  [8, 12, 22]

2. **Further divide the sublists:**
   [16, 21]  [11]  [8, 12]  [22]

3. **Sort each sublist:**
   - Merging [16, 21] and [11]:
     [11, 16, 21]
   - Merging [8, 12] and [22]:
     [8, 12, 22]

4. **Merge the sorted sublists:**
   [11, 16, 21]  [8, 12, 22]

5. **Final sorted list:**
   [8, 11, 12, 16, 21, 22]

## Conclusion

The Merge Sort algorithm successfully sorts the input list from [16, 21, 11, 8, 12, 22] to [8, 11, 12, 16, 21, 22] using a divide-and-conquer approach.
